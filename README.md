# DermDNN
A binary classifier for skin diseases. 
Two main files are added. hsv_dnn for the same folder of images for test and train. hsv_dnn_test_train is for separate folders of test and train images.
Copy all the .m files to run and run the main file.
preprocNet_new.mat is the preprocessor previously trained. It can be called directly, or you can download the code and train your own dataset.
